# Spotify Application

React-JS Application that enables a user to search for and listen to any song inside of Spotify's Database.

## How the app works

You enter a specific song in the input field that you would wish to listen to, upon pressing enter the application 
will generate a list of songs that correspond to the search term that you queried for. Once the list has
been generated and you click on the song you wish to listen to you will be directed to a new tab where you can 
listen to the song.

## Technologies Used

JSX, CSS, Javascript, React-JS, and the Axios Library.

## How to get the App Started

You want to clone the app onto your local machine, after cloning you want to enter the directory that contains
all of the project files and run npm install in-order to install all the dependencies that the project relies 
on. Once the dependencies are fully installed then you want to run npm install in-order to open up the application.
